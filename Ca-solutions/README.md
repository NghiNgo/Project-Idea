Ca-solutions basically stands for cable solutions which deals with solutions related to cables. From this application customer can send online complaints to the administrator regardless of calling or by meeting him at his office. Further when the complaint has been registered administrator can view the complaint in his database.
As soon as customer registers a complaint an automated message is sent to the customer which contains his ticket no for future reference. Further Administrator issues the complaint to the ideal lineman through this application. And as soon as the complaint is allotted to a lineman an automated message is sent to lineman about the ticket no and allotted time to solve the issue. When customer closes the complaint through this application again an automated message along with a mail is sent to both admin and lineman.
So basically Ca-solutions revolve around 3 modules i.e Admin, Lineman and Customer. All of these have different database which are interlinked with each other.
